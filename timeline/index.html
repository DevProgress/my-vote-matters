                <h2>What's at stake?</h2>
                <p>Electing the first female president has enormous implications for our country.</p>

                <h3>We could have universal paid family leave for the first time.</h3>
                <p>
                    As the only developed nation without any guaranteed paid family leave, we need to
                    elect someone who understands the unique demands for parents in today’s society.
                </p>

                <h3>We could enact equal pay for women.</h3>
                <p>
                    Surprisingly and shockingly women still make less than men for the same job. Wait,
                    what? It's true and time for that to change. Electing the first female into the White
                    House means that our rights will be wholly represented for the first time.
                </p>

                <h3>We could have affordable AND quality childcare.</h3>
                <p>
                    Given the cost of childcare&mdash;approximately 25 percent of household income&mdash;it
                    is often too cost-prohibitive for many families. We deserve a leader who considers this
                    constraint and promises to invest in less expensive, quality care for our children.
